Write a hyper-detailed investigation report on the additional error processing techniques in Rust Analyzer that are relevant for the task of parsing JSON error messages in cargo-cgp to improve the error messages of CGP code.

Write a detailed walk through of the relevant parts of Rust Analyzer on how it intercepts error messages from Cargo and Rustc, parses the errors, and analyze them to be displayed on the UI.

Skip the IDE-specific details that are not relevant to improving CGP error messages, such as UI rendering and editor integration.

Show the relevant code snippets and locations in Rust Analyzer that performs the relevant processing.

Start your report by writing a summary, followed by a detailed table of content including all sub-sections. Before writing each chapter, start with a detailed outline of what you will write inside each section of that chapter.

Use full sentences and avoid point forms and tables.
