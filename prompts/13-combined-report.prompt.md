Read through the given reports, and write a hyper-detailed, deep dive combined report that talks about the development plan for cargo-cgp.

The main purpose of cargo-cgp would be to run the Cargo commands like `cargo check` via `cargo cgp check`, and the tool would intercept any error message produced and present them in a much more user-friendly and CGP-aware way.

Your report should replace all other reports, and so should be fully independent of the other reports.

You should include all related information necessary to develop cargo-cgp based on your report. This includes but not limited to: problem statement, motivation, analysis, specification, implementation strategy, and potential challenges.

Your report don't need to focus on information that are not related to the development of cgp-serde. For example, you can skip or briefly mention alternative approaches such as modifying the Rust compiler directly.

Start your report by writing a summary, followed by a detailed table of content including all sub-sections. 

The draft report is being worked on at 13-combined-report.report.md. Currently, we have written until chapter 6, and the remaining chapters are not yet written.
Continue writing the full report from chapter 7 to the end. Follow the table of content at the beginning of the report.

Before writing each chapter, write a detailed outline of what you will write inside each section of that chapter. Then only start writing the actual chapter.

Use full sentences and avoid point forms and tables.
