We will follow the directions in the given reports to build a new cargo-cgp crate that will intercept JSON output from cargo check with `--message-format=json` enabled, and display improved error messages for CGP code.

Before we start, help me identify all online resources that will be helpful for this task, such as documentation, tutorials, and example projects related to building cargo plugins, working with cargo's JSON output, and improving error messages in Rust. 

Scan through all the relevant online resources, and write a self-contained deep-dive report summarizing all the key information, best practices, and potential pitfalls to be aware of when building a cargo plugin like cargo-cgp.
